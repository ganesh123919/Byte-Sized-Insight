Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
What is a PET scanner used for?

A PET scanner is used to detect and monitor various conditions, including cancer, neurological disorders, and cardiovascular diseases, by producing detailed images of organs and tissues.

How much does a PET scanner cost?

The cost of a PET scanner can range from USD 1 million to USD 3 million, depending on the model and technological features.

What is the lifespan of a PET scanner?

The average lifespan of a PET scanner is typically around 10-15 years, depending on the model and maintenance practices.

What are the side effects of a PET scan?

While PET scans are generally safe, potential side effects include allergic reactions to the injected radioactive material and minimal radiation exposure.

Are PET scans covered by insurance?

Yes, PET scans are typically covered by insurance, especially if they are deemed medically necessary for diagnosing specific conditions like cancer.

Can PET scans detect early-stage cancer?

Yes, PET scans are highly effective in detecting early-stage cancer by identifying abnormal metabolic activity in cells.

What are the benefits of hybrid PET-CT scanners?

Hybrid PET-CT scanners combine the detailed metabolic imaging of PET with the anatomical imaging of CT, improving diagnostic accuracy and treatment planning.

How does PET scanning work?

PET scanning works by using a small amount of radioactive glucose injected into the body to detect areas with high metabolic activity, which are indicative of disease.

Is a PET scan the same as a CT scan?

No, a PET scan measures metabolic activity, while a CT scan provides detailed anatomical images of the body. Combining both in PET-CT provides a comprehensive view.

How accurate is a PET scan?

PET scans are highly accurate for detecting certain cancers and neurological disorders, although they may have limitations in diagnosing some conditions without additional tests.
